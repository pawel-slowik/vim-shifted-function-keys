This is a micro-plugin for the [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) editor. It translates
key codes for shifted function keys (e.g. Shift + F1) into key names that can
be used in a mapping. For details, see `:help set-termcap`.

Note: whether this plugin will be useful to you or not depends on your terminal
emulator, termcap configuration etc. It is possible that your Linux / Vim
distribution ships with these key codes already defined.
